# pilots-territories

This folder is dedicated to experimentation feedback and pilot experiences from territories, collectives, or organizations wishing to implement the TOGAFrance method.

---

## Purpose

- **Share concrete field feedback** from first pilot projects (communes, associations, collectives, public services…)
- **Document what works, what doesn’t, and what was adapted** (“right to detour”)
- **Help others learn from real-world experiments** and encourage cross-territory dialogue

---

## How to contribute?

1. **Create a new subfolder**:  
   Name it after your territory/group (e.g., `dunkerque-2026`, `lyon-collective`, `moselle-experiment`).

2. **Add the following files** (templates are available in `/examples`):
   - `diagnostic.md` – initial assessment, needs, and challenges
   - `plan-action.md` – roadmap, goals, timeline, local adaptations
   - `rapport-experience.md` – outcomes, lessons learned, obstacles, recommendations
   - `README.md` (optional) – short intro to your context/team

3. **Anonymize sensitive data**:  
   Remove any confidential names or data you do not wish to publish.

4. **Submit your folder via Pull Request** or ask for help on [github@jagrat.fr](mailto:github@jagrat.fr).
