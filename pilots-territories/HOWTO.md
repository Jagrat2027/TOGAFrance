## How to contribute a pilot?

1. **Create a subfolder**  
   Name it after your territory or group (e.g., `paris-pilot`, `collective-lyon-2027`, `service-public-ouest`).

2. **Include the following files:**

   - `diagnostic.md`: initial assessment, context, needs, starting point
   - `plan-action.md`: action plan, roadmap, local adaptations
   - `rapport-experience.md`: feedback, obstacles, lessons learned, recommendations
   - `README.md` _(optional)_: short intro to your context/team

3. **Anonymize sensitive data**  
   Remove any confidential names or data you do not wish to publish.

4. **Submit your subfolder via Pull Request**  
   Or email the team for help: [github@jagrat.fr](mailto:github@jagrat.fr)
