# Business Architecture – School Traffic Light

## a) Brief Summary

Mapping of the organization and interactions between services involved in the “school traffic light” project.

## b) Scope Covered

- Municipal services involved: technical, communication, local police.
- Partners: supplier company, primary school, parents' association.

## c) Current State (“as is”)

- Parents report problems to the principal.
- Principal forwards to the town hall (deputy for safety).
- No formal process to collect and handle “road safety” alerts.
- Roadwork interventions are rare and planned annually.

## d) Target State (“to be”)

- Direct channel parents <-> town hall (via website or quarterly meeting).
- Technical service in charge of study and project follow-up.
- Local police involved early for temporary safety during works.
- School informs families and collects feedback after installation.

## e) Gap Analysis and Transformation Axes

- Current weakness: slow information flow, lack of post-project feedback.
- Transformation: direct dialogue, improved information, feedback loop.
- Need to clarify roles (who decides, who informs, who validates).

## f) Stakeholders Involved

- Technical service, local police, school management, parents.

## g) Linked or Dependent Deliverables

- Action plan, completion report, feedback report.

## h) Change History

- 2025-07-07: First draft, validated by safety committee.
