# Information Flows Architecture – School Traffic Light

## a) Brief Summary

Mapping of information circuits, from needs identification to feedback after the traffic light is installed.

## b) Scope Covered

- Information related to the “school traffic light” project.
- Actors: town hall, school, families, supplier, local police.

## c) Mapping of Current Flows

- **Before the project:** Parents -> School Principal -> Town Hall
- **Consultation:** Town Hall -> Public meeting/survey -> Parents/Families
- **Works:** Town Hall -> Notices + website updates -> Residents
- **After installation:** School -> Quick questionnaire -> Parents

## d) Strengths and Weaknesses Analysis

- Strength: genuine upstream listening, family involvement.
- Weakness: lack of “real-time” information during works, little feedback after works.
- Silo between technical and communication services.

## e) Improvement Recommendations

- Live works updates (website, info panel).
- “Safety ambassador” among parents for quick feedback.
- Automated satisfaction survey (QR code on poster).

## f) Stakeholders Concerned

- Communications department, school management, “ambassador” parents, technical service.

## g) Monitoring Indicators

- % of families informed (>95%)
- Number of feedbacks collected (>50% of families)
- Average alert handling time (<48h)

## h) Change History

- 2025-07-07: First version, to be tested during works.
