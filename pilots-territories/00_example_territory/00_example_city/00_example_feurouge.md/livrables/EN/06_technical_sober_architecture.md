# Technical/Sober Architecture – School Traffic Light

## a) Brief Summary

Description of technical choices for a simple, robust, energy-efficient and accessible installation.

## b) Technological Scope Covered

- Pedestrian traffic light system (low-power LED)
- PRM signaling (call button, sound signal)
- Installation “Smart City” compatible but not cloud-dependent

## c) Mapping of Existing Equipment

- No existing traffic light on the street; old “school” sign
- Streetlamp nearby (possible power source)

## d) Analysis of Sobriety, Security, Accessibility

- Estimated consumption: <50 kWh/year
- Use of robust, easy-to-maintain equipment
- Accessibility: wide button, sound signal for PRM, regulation-compliant height

## e) Future Technical Needs / Evolution Axes

- Future option: pedestrian counter (anonymous stats)
- Possible addition of QR code to report malfunctions

## f) Action Plan or Recommendations

- Priority to standardized, easily repairable equipment (no proprietary solution)
- Document maintenance procedures for municipal staff

## g) Technical Stakeholders Involved

- Town hall technical service, supplier, accessibility manager, digital referent

## h) Monitoring Indicators

- Number of breakdowns over 12 months (target: 0)
- Average response time (target: <72h)
- PRM user feedback (target: >80% satisfied)

## i) Change History

- 2025-07-07: First draft, pending validation.
