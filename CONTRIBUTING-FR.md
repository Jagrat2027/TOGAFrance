# Contributing to TOGAFrance
_Version française : ce dépôt existe aussi en anglais : [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)_

Thank you for your interest in TOGAFrance!  
This project is living, evolving, and open to all contributions that respect its founding principles: clarity, transmission, reversibility, real impact, and human ethics.

## Who can contribute?

- **Citizens, elected officials, public servants, youth**
- **Architects of ideas, organizations, or systems**
- **Developers, makers, digital artisans**
- **Transformation practitioners (facilitators, coaches, trainers, etc.)**
- **Local collectives, associations**
- **Anyone or any group wishing to experiment, document, or improve the method**

---

## Priorities and Tasks

### 1. Essential Document Templates
- Local diagnosis (situation analysis, needs, strengths/weaknesses)
- Action plan or roadmap (objectives, timeline, stakeholders)
- Experience report (successes, obstacles, adjustments, proposals)

### 2. Tracking Tables
- Experimentation dashboard (progress, blockers, feedback)
- Human and organizational impact evaluation grids

### 3. Practical Guides and Tutorials
- User guide for the TOGAFrance method
- Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
- Simplified glossary

### 4. Digital Tools and Collaborative Spaces
- Collaborative platform or space (wiki, document sharing, downloadable templates)
- Shared dashboard or open data for ongoing experiments
- **Creation and management of community spaces: Discord servers, Twitch channels, external forums, or any platform to connect and unite the TOGAFrance community**

### 5. Support Network and Reference Contacts
- List of references (volunteers, experts, local coordinators)
- Communication channels (workshops, video meetings, forums, etc.)

### 6. Freedom of Adaptation and Sharing
- Each territory can adapt the method (“right to detour”)
- But must document and share their choices, successes, and challenges

### 7. Tools for Translation and Document Generation
- Develop scripts or tools to automate translation (Markdown ↔️ English/French, etc.)
- Provide automatic generators for PDF, Word (.docx), or Excel (.xlsx) from Markdown sources or other formats used in the project
- Create tools to check the consistency or update status between language versions

## How to contribute?

### 1. Propose a territorial or local experiment

- Download the experimentation kit (diagnosis templates, roadmap, tracking tables, etc.)
- Adapt it to your territory, structure, collective, or team
- Conduct the experiment, documenting each step, success, adjustment, or challenge

### 2. Share your feedback

- Write an **experience report** (successes, challenges, proposals, local adaptations…)
- Submit it via a _pull request_ on the main repository, or send it to the coordination team
- **Help us create and animate exchange and support spaces for the community: Discord servers, Twitch channels, external forums, or other collaborative platforms.**
- **Propose or co-organize workshops, Q&A sessions, or discussion groups to support contributors and pilot territories.**
- **Suggest or help develop new ways for the community to connect, share, and support each other.**

### 3. Improve the method, tools, or documentation

- Suggest improvements to documentation templates, guides, or tracking tables
- Propose new digital tools or educational resources
- Contribute to the glossary, FAQ, translation, or outreach

### 4. Correct or report an inconsistency

- Open an “issue” on the repository or make a _pull request_ for any correction or clarification
- Always favor kindness, clarity, and sharing of your experience

## Golden Rules

- **Clarity**: prioritize readable, accessible documents and feedback
- **Transparency**: explain what was tried, what worked or didn’t, and why
- **Reversibility**: any experiment can be adapted or withdrawn if it no longer serves the human connection
- **Ethics**: respect the diversity of territories, approaches, and adaptation paces
