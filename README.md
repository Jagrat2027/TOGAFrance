# TOGAFrance
_A French version is available: [README-FR.md](./README-FR.md)_

**TOGAFrance** is a national transformation method, inspired by the TOGAF framework (The Open Group Architecture Framework), adapted to rebuild France’s public services, restore civic trust, and transmit an ethical, sustainable vision of change.

## Spirit of the Project — A Gift for the Future

TOGAFrance is not a campaign.  
It is not a personal manifesto, nor a bid for power.

It is a **framework**, offered openly to the nation.  
A rigorous, readable, and shareable tool, designed to **repair what can be repaired**, bring structure where there is vagueness, and help rebuild trust between citizens, institutions, and territories.

I claim no absolute truth, no perfect solution.  
But I wanted to prove that it is possible to **act with seriousness, clarity, humility — and pass it on.**

If there are mistakes in this framework, let them be corrected.  
If it can be improved, let others do it.  
Because **this repository is not a doctrine — it's an invitation.**

### For Those Who Will Come After Us

One day, we too will be fragile — as many already are.  
And when that time comes, **today’s youth will be the ones holding the nation together.**

This project is for them.  
Not to constrain — but to give them the tools to imagine, rebuild, and pass something better on.

If this framework helps just one territory collaborate better,  
one public service breathe easier,  
or one young person say *“I can build something”* —  
then it will have already fulfilled its mission.

## Why TOGAFrance?

For too long, France has accumulated reforms and measures without an overarching vision. The result: confusion, loss of meaning, civic disengagement.  
**TOGAFrance** aims to transform chaos into coherence, without imposing a single model. It is a clear, adaptable framework, rooted in reality, to rebuild a collective backbone.

---

## Vision

To give every citizen, public servant, elected official, and territory the capacity to act in the nation's transformation, following a rigorous, humane, and shareable method.  
TOGAFrance is not a technocratic program: it is for everyone who wants to understand, participate, and rebuild together.

---

## Founding Principles

- **Clarity**: Everything should be understandable by a 10-year-old child.
- **Reversibility**: Nothing is final if the human connection is broken.
- **Transmission**: What is created should be able to be taken up and improved.
- **Real Impact**: Decisions are judged by what they change in people’s lives.
- **Balance of Power**: No one decides alone; everyone keeps their place in the loop.
- **Territorial Adaptability**: Each place adapts without betraying the spirit of the vision.
- **Shared Memory**: Everything is documented, archived, and accessible.
- **Gentle Justice**: We repair before we punish, we help people grow without crushing them.

[See the complete list of principles in the Practical Guide.]

## The Method at a Glance

1. **A clear, shared vision** – emerging from lived experiences, needs, and observed hardships.
2. **A structuring framework** – inspired by TOGAF, adapted to human scale, operating in circles, feedback loops, and methodological transparency.
3. **Public, readable, reversible documents** – for every stage, commitment, and experiment.
4. **Living roles** – every citizen, public servant, elected official, professional or “invisible” person can become an actor, proposer, connector, guardian, or builder.
5. **Pilot territories** – every municipality, service, or structure can adapt the method to its reality and share its feedback.

---

## For Whom?

- Citizens who want to understand and act.
- Elected officials looking for a human compass.
- Public servants seeking meaning and recognition.
- Young people who refuse to be mere spectators.
- Architects of ideas, organizations, or systems who want to adapt, transmit, and bring the method to life in the field.
- Developers, makers, and digital artisans who create and maintain free, open, human-centered tools.
- Practitioners and thinkers in transformation (facilitators, coaches, trainers…) wishing to embody an iterative, living, and deeply human approach.
- All territories wishing to reclaim control over their collective destiny, regardless of size, context, or history.
- **Anyone who has ever thought, even once: “things need to change.”**

### ADM Cycle – TOGAFrance Interpretation

Below is the transformation cycle as interpreted by the TOGAFrance method.  
Inspired by the TOGAF® framework, it recenters each phase around **citizen requirements**, in an iterative, transparent, and reproducible approach.
