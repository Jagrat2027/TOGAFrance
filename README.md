# TOGAFrance

**TOGAFrance** is a national transformation framework, inspired by TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture Framework), and adapted to rebuild French public services, restore citizen trust, and promote an ethical and sustainable vision of change.

## Why TOGAFrance?

For too long, France has accumulated reforms and measures without an overarching vision. The result: confusion, loss of meaning, and growing citizen disengagement.  
TOGAFrance aims to turn chaos into coherence—without imposing a single model. It offers a readable, adaptable, reality-based framework to rebuild the nation’s backbone.

## Vision

Empower every citizen, civil servant, elected official, and territory to take part in transforming the nation, using a rigorous, human-centered, and transmissible method.  
TOGAFrance is not a technocrats’ program—it is for all those who want to understand, participate, and rebuild together.

## Core Principles

- **Clarity:** Everything should be understandable by a 10-year-old.
- **Reversibility:** Nothing is permanent if it breaks the human link.
- **Transmission:** What is created should be reusable and improvable.
- **Real Impact:** Decisions are judged by what they change in people’s lives.
- **Balance of Forces:** No one decides alone; everyone keeps their place in the loop.
- **Territorial Adaptability:** Each place can adjust without betraying the spirit.
- **Shared Memory:** Everything is documented, archived, accessible.
- **Gentle Justice:** We repair before we punish; we help people grow rather than crush.

## The Method in Brief

- A clear, shared vision—rooted in real-life needs and struggles.
- A structured framework—inspired by TOGAF, human-adapted, working through circles, control loops, and transparent methodology.
- Public, readable, reversible documentation—for each step, commitment, and experiment.
- Living roles—any citizen, agent, elected official, professional, or "invisible" person can become an actor, proposer, connector, guardian, or builder.
- Pilot territories—each municipality, service, or structure can adapt the method to its reality and share its feedback.

## Who is it for?

- Citizens who want to understand and act.
- Elected officials seeking a human compass.
- Public agents searching for meaning and recognition.
- Young people who refuse to remain spectators.
- All territories wishing to take control of their collective future.
