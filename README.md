## Why TOGAFrance?

For too long, France has accumulated reforms and measures without an overarching vision. The result: confusion, loss of meaning, civic disengagement.  
**TOGAFrance** aims to transform chaos into coherence, without imposing a single model. It is a clear, adaptable framework, rooted in reality, to rebuild a collective backbone.

---

## Vision

To give every citizen, public servant, elected official, and territory the capacity to act in the nation's transformation, following a rigorous, humane, and shareable method.  
TOGAFrance is not a technocratic program: it is for everyone who wants to understand, participate, and rebuild together.

---

## Founding Principles

- **Clarity**: Everything should be understandable by a 10-year-old child.
- **Reversibility**: Nothing is final if the human connection is broken.
- **Transmission**: What is created should be able to be taken up and improved.
- **Real Impact**: Decisions are judged by what they change in people’s lives.
- **Balance of Power**: No one decides alone; everyone keeps their place in the loop.
- **Territorial Adaptability**: Each place adapts without betraying the spirit of the vision.
- **Shared Memory**: Everything is documented, archived, and accessible.
- **Gentle Justice**: We repair before we punish, we help people grow without crushing them.

## The Method at a Glance

1. **A clear, shared vision** – emerging from lived experiences, needs, and observed hardships.
2. **A structuring framework** – inspired by TOGAF, adapted to human scale, operating in circles, feedback loops, and methodological transparency.
3. **Public, readable, reversible documents** – for every stage, commitment, and experiment.
4. **Living roles** – every citizen, public servant, elected official, professional or “invisible” person can become an actor, proposer, connector, guardian, or builder.
5. **Pilot territories** – every municipality, service, or structure can adapt the method to its reality and share its feedback.

## For Whom?

- Citizens who want to understand and act.
- Elected officials looking for a human compass.
- Public servants seeking meaning and recognition.
- Young people who refuse to be mere spectators.
- Architects of ideas, organizations, or systems who want to adapt, transmit, and bring the method to life in the field.
- Developers, makers, and digital artisans who create and maintain free, open, human-centered tools.
- Practitioners and thinkers in transformation (facilitators, coaches, trainers…) wishing to embody an iterative, living, and deeply human approach.
- All territories wishing to reclaim control over their collective destiny, regardless of size, context, or history.
- **Anyone who has ever thought, even once: “things need to change.”**
