# TOGAFrance – Governance Model

_A French version is available: [GOVERNANCE-FR.md](./GOVERNANCE-FR.md)_

## Purpose

This document describes how the TOGAFrance project is governed and how contributors, maintainers, and the wider community participate in decision-making and evolution.

---

## 1. Principles

- **Transparency**: All major decisions, changes, and debates are documented and accessible to everyone.
- **Openness**: Everyone is welcome to propose ideas, raise issues, and participate.
- **Inclusiveness**: We value diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and expertise.
- **Iterative improvement**: The governance and the project itself evolve based on feedback and experimentation.

---

## 2. Roles & Responsibilities

### **Contributors**

- Anyone submitting ideas, issues, documentation, code, feedback, or field experience.
- Can propose new features, tools, or improvements by Pull Request or Issue.
- May participate in pilot territories, workshops, and discussions.

### **Maintainers**

- Review and merge Pull Requests.
- Moderate discussions and ensure the Code of Conduct is followed.
- Prioritize, triage, and update issues.
- Facilitate onboarding of new contributors and pilot territories.
- Can be appointed or rotate over time, with transparency.

### **Community Animators & Pilot Facilitators** (optional, as the project grows)

- Organize workshops, manage Discord/Forums, collect and share field feedback.
- Help onboard new participants in pilot territories.

---

## 3. Decision-Making Process

- **Consensus Seeking**: Discussions on Issues and Pull Requests should seek broad agreement.
- **Simple majority** for decisions among maintainers if consensus is not clear.
- **Major changes** (methodology, vision, license, code of conduct) are discussed openly and require broad community feedback.
- Any contributor can initiate a proposal via Issue or Pull Request.

---

## 4. How to Join or Get Involved

- Read the [README.md](./README.md) and [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
- Propose an Issue or Pull Request for any topic (documentation, tools, community…).
- Join or help animate community channels (Discord, forum, workshops).
- Express interest in becoming a maintainer or facilitator in an Issue.

---

## 5. Changes to Governance

- This document itself can be proposed for revision by any contributor via Pull Request.
- Substantial changes require explicit community notice (Issue + announcement in all channels).
- All changes are documented in Git history and referenced in the changelog.
