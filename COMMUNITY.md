# 🤝 COMMUNITY.md – TOGAFrance

Welcome to the TOGAFrance community.  
This project is not a product. It is an invitation —  
to reconnect citizens, institutions, and public services around a shared future.

---

## 🌱 Why a community?

Because TOGAFrance is not a software, nor a doctrine.  
It is a **living method** — and it only exists if it’s shared, challenged, improved, passed on.

You are in the right place if you want to:

- Improve an idea or a document  
- Test the method in your local context  
- Offer a new angle or interpretation  
- Connect other territories or actors  
- Learn, understand, and transmit  

---

## 🔧 How to contribute

- 💡 **Issues** — Ask a question, suggest an improvement, share constructive feedback  
- 📄 **Pull requests** — Propose edits, new content, fixes  
- 🧪 **Field tests** — Share what works or what fails in your pilot territory  
- 🌍 **Translations** — Help make the project accessible to others  
- 📢 **Outreach** — Share the project in your networks, communities, media

All contributions are reviewed with care.  
If you're not familiar with GitHub, we’re happy to help.

## ✨ Project spirit

> TOGAFrance is not a solution.  
> It is a way of searching together — with seriousness, clarity… and kindness.

Thank you for being here.  
Thank you for helping hold open this civic breach in the system.
