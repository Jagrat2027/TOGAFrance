# Tools for TOGAFrance

_A French version is available: [README-FR.md](./README-FR.md)_

This folder gathers all scripts, templates, and automation tools designed to help contributors and pilot territories with TOGAFrance documentation and feedback.

---

## What can you contribute here?

- **Automation scripts:** e.g., Markdown to PDF/Docx/Xlsx, translation synchronizers, template generators, etc.
- **Templates:** Markdown, Docx, Excel, to help new pilots create their documents easily.
- **Other tools:** any utility facilitating sharing, reporting, or data visualization for the project.

---

## Folders

- `scripts/`: code/scripts for automation or processing
- `templates/`: document or report templates (community-friendly, lightweight)
- `docx/`: Word, Excel, or other office formats

---

## Documentation & Starter Kit

All main templates and examples are available in:

- `/tools/templates/` : community reporting templates (simple, adaptable)
- `/examples/` : real-world cases and strict TOGAF-style documents (versioned, with official headers)
- `/documentation/` : reference guides, glossaries, and the full practical handbook

**Best practices:**
- Use the template best suited to your context (lightweight or strict TOGAF format)
- For official or institutional documents, refer to strict TOGAF models from `/examples`
- Always fill in version, author, and changelog if using a formal document
- Check `NAMING-CONVENTION.md` for file naming rules
- When in doubt, ask or propose an improvement!
