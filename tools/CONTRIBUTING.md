## 🔧 Identified Needs & Open Ideas

- ✅ **Markdown → PDF / DOCX / XLSX converters**  
  To quickly produce shareable documents from `.md` files.

- ✅ **Smart bilingual translation (Markdown ↔️ EN/FR)**  
  Detects changes and updates translated sections automatically.

- 🧩 **Template generators**  
  Easily create templates for diagnostics, action plans, or experience reports (Markdown, Word, Excel).

- 🔍 **Checklists and contributor guides**  
  Help new contributors structure, document, and clarify their inputs.

- 📄 **Example data and fictional cases**  
  Useful for testing tools with realistic content (e.g. sample municipalities, deliverables, roadmaps).

- 🔁 **Cross-repo monitoring (Programme2027 → TOGAFrance)**  
  Detect major changes in the Programme repo and automatically create an issue in TOGAFrance if it impacts vision or principles.

- 🧪 **Matrix or catalog generators**  
  Based on YAML/JSON files — for stakeholder maps, role matrices, needs catalogs.

- 🔗 **Dynamic diagrams**  
  Automatically generate ADM cycles or role/flow representations.

- 🧠 **AI assistants or writing prompts**  
  To help contributors write clearly and in the TOGAFrance spirit (clarity, care, usefulness).
