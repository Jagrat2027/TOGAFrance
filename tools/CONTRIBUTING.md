# Contributions to TOGAFrance Tools

TOGAFrance is not just a method — it's a collaborative workspace.  
If you like building scripts, organizing processes, or making life easier for contributors — you're in the right place.

## 🔧 Identified Needs & Open Ideas

- ✅ **Markdown → PDF / DOCX / XLSX converters**  
  To generate readable documents from `.md` files quickly and easily.

- ✅ **Smart bilingual translation sync (Markdown ↔️ EN/FR)**  
  Auto-detect changes and update translated sections accordingly.

- 🧩 **Template generators**  
  Tools to generate editable templates (diagnostics, action plans, reports) in Markdown, Word, or Excel formats.

- 🔍 **Checklists and contributor onboarding guides**  
  To help newcomers structure and document their contributions clearly.

- 📄 **Example data and fictional case studies**  
  Useful for testing tools with realistic demo data (e.g., fictitious town, deliverables, sample plans).

- 🔁 **Cross-repo monitoring (Programme2027 → TOGAFrance)**  
  Detect major updates in the Programme repo and automatically create an issue in TOGAFrance if they impact vision, principles, or deliverables.

- 🧪 **Matrix or catalog generators**  
  Based on YAML/JSON input — e.g., stakeholder maps, role matrices, needs catalogs.

- 🔗 **Dynamic diagram generators**  
  Automatically create ADM flowcharts or relationship graphs between roles/phases.

- 🧠 **AI-assisted prompts or editors**  
  Help contributors write in the spirit of TOGAFrance: with clarity, kindness, and usefulness.
