# üõ†Ô∏è Deliverable Guide: Architecture Contracts

## 1. Definition

**Architecture contracts** are formal agreements between stakeholders (services, territories, partners) on objectives, deliverables, collaboration modalities, and success criteria for a transformation.  
They secure coherence, accountability, and clarity at each project stage.

## 2. Purpose of the Deliverable

- Formalize mutual commitments: who is responsible for what, for whom, with what means
- Specify objectives, deliverables, validation criteria, and monitoring arrangements
- Clarify roles, responsibilities, interfaces, and possible arbitration procedures
- Serve as a reference in case of disagreement or project review

## 3. Recommended Structure

### a) Title, date, author, version

### b) Contracting parties

- List and description of each committed party (services, local authorities, partners, etc.)

### c) Object of the contract

- Project, scope, ambitions, context

### d) Mutual commitments

- What each party agrees to provide, guarantee, or respect

### e) Deliverables and deadlines

- Expected outputs, associated deadlines, delivery arrangements

### f) Governance and monitoring modalities

- Steering rules, committees, reporting, adaptation, arbitration

### g) Validation criteria and success indicators

- How compliance and success will be evaluated

### h) Modification or termination modalities
