# 🛠️ Deliverable Guide: Vision Document

## 1. Definition

The **Vision Document** sets the purpose, long-term objectives, and ethical direction of a transformation (national, territorial, sectoral, etc.).  
It is the alignment deliverable—the compass guiding all following steps of the TOGAFrance project.

## 2. Deliverable Purpose

- Clarify **what we want to change and why**
- Align all stakeholders around a shared intention
- Define the expected added value for each actor
- Frame key objectives and major constraints
- Provide a stable, readable, and transferable reference point

## 3. Recommended Structure

> Adapt as needed (national, local, etc.), but always ensure simplicity and clarity.

### a) Title, date, author, version

- Project or vision title
- Date, version, author(s)

### b) Executive summary / Purpose

- 1 to 3 sentences summarizing the project’s ambition and reason for being

### c) Expected benefits / Added value

- What improvements or positive changes are targeted for citizens, territories, public services, etc.

### d) Major constraints or key assumptions

- Contextual limitations, known obstacles, critical assumptions to be monitored

### e) Long-term objectives

- 3 to 10 key points: expected results, core values, targeted transformations

### f) Ethical compass and guiding principles

- The core values (clarity, transferability, reversibility, etc.)
- TOGAFrance principles or project-specific ones

### g) Key stakeholders

- Main groups involved (citizens, civil servants, elected officials, experts, users, etc.)

### h) Scope

- Who, what, where? (domains, territories, affected levels)

### i) Success indicators / KPIs

- How will progress and impact be measured?

### j) Glossary (if needed)

- Definitions of project-specific terms, to ensure accessibility for all

### k) Change history

- Simple table (date, author, modification)

## 4. Writing Tips

- **Simple language** (understandable by a 10-year-old)
- **Conciseness**: ideally no more than 2 pages, avoid verbosity
- **Accessibility**: clarify every complex term or notion
- **Readability**: use lists, tables, and summaries where possible
- **Neutrality**: the vision states _why_, not _how_

---

## 5. Key Points to Watch

- Do not confuse vision with action plan
- Explicitly mention constraints, assumptions, and key stakeholders
- Invite feedback from diverse profiles to avoid jargon
- Always state **date, version, and author**
- Provide a glossary when specific terms are used
