## 1. Definition

The **Statement of Architecture Work** describes the scope, responsibilities, resources, and initial schedule of a TOGAFrance intervention (service, territory, sector, etc.).  
It serves as a project charter‚Äîa contract that formalizes expectations, sets ground rules, and secures project initiation.

## 2. Purpose of the Deliverable

- Clarify **what will be done, by whom, for whom, and within what timeframe**
