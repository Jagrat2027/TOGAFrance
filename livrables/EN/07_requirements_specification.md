## 1. Definition

The **requirements specification** lists and details all requirements to be met for successful transformation: criteria for clarity, reversibility, security, performance, accessibility, etc.  
It serves as a ‚Äúquality contract‚Äù: every deliverable or solution will be validated if it meets these requirements.

## 2. Purpose of the Deliverable

- Clarify **what is mandatory, desired, prohibited, or optional**
- Enable objective evaluation of delivered solutions or projects
- Serve as the basis for validation and acceptance of deliverables
