# üõ†Ô∏è Deliverable Guide: Technical/Sober Architecture

## 1. Definition

**Technical/sober architecture** describes the infrastructures, tools, solutions, and technical resources needed to support transformation, focusing on simplicity, durability, energy sobriety, and accessibility.  
This deliverable sets the foundations for technology serving real needs, avoiding excess and unnecessary dependency.

## 2. Purpose of the Deliverable

- Identify tools and infrastructures truly needed for the mission
- Assess sobriety, security, and maintainability of existing or planned solutions
- Propose improvements or simplification pathways
- Support autonomy, resilience, and accessibility for all

## 3. Recommended Structure

### a) Title, date, author, version

### b) Brief summary

- 2‚Äì3 sentences on the document‚Äôs scope

### c) Technological scope covered

- Domains, services, systems analyzed

### d) Mapping of existing infrastructures/tools

- Inventory of solutions, software, hardware in use
- Strengths, weaknesses, redundancies

### e) Analysis of sobriety, security, and accessibility

- Energy consumption, third-party dependencies, ease of use, openness

### f) Future technical needs / areas for improvement

- Tools/infrastructure to upgrade, replace, or simplify
- New solutions considered (priority on open source, repairability, etc.)

### g) Action plan or recommendations

- Investment priorities, migration schedule, best practices to promote

### h) Technical stakeholders involved

- IT teams, technicians, users, external partners, etc.

### i) Monitoring indicators

- Consumption reduction, incident rates, satisfaction, costs avoided, etc.

### j) Change history

## 4. Writing Tips

- Favor clarity over technicality: explain each technical term
- Use user and expert feedback to assess ‚Äúreal‚Äù sobriety
- Emphasize maintainability and technological independence
- Highlight opportunities to ‚Äúdo more with less‚Äù

## 5. Key Points to Watch

- Beware of hidden dependencies (proprietary software, opaque cloud, etc.)
- Check compatibility with real user needs
- Integrate ecological dimension (repairability, reuse, consumption)
