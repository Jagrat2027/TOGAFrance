## 1. Definition

It visualizes and optimizes communication pathways, identifies blockages or silos, and supports transparency and collaboration.

## 2. Purpose of the Deliverable

- Map **who communicates with whom, how, about what, and using which channels**
- Identify strengths, weaknesses, and friction points in information flows
- Improve clarity, speed, and security of exchanges
- Promote equitable access to information for all stakeholders

## 3. Recommended Structure

### a) Title, date, author, version

### b) Brief summary

- 2‚Äì3 sentences describing the document‚Äôs scope

### c) Scope covered

- Structures, domains, or levels analyzed

### d) Mapping of current flows

- Graphical or tabular description of information circuits
- Sources, channels, recipients, frequency, and tools used

### e) Analysis of strengths and weaknesses

- Strengths (transparency, speed, etc.)
- Weaknesses (blockages, silos, opacity, information loss)

### f) Improvement recommendations

- Actions to streamline, secure, and democratize information circulation
- New practices or tools to implement

### g) Relevant stakeholders
