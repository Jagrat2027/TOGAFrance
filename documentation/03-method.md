# TOGAFrance – Chapter 3: The Method

_French version available here: [03-method-FR.md](./03-method-FR.md)_

## Why a Method?

Too many reforms in France have failed for lack of method.  
They stack up, contradict each other, or remain disconnected from real life.

**TOGAFrance is not another reform. It is a method.**  
A method for rebuilding, not just reorganizing.  
A method to restore meaning, not to add administrative layers.  
A method that helps territories act with coherence, clarity, and humanity.

## Methodological Foundations

TOGAFrance is inspired by the TOGAF framework (The Open Group Architecture Framework), widely used in systemic transformations.  
It has been adapted to the French context to serve the common good — not corporate interests.

Its key principles:

- **A clear, shared, evolving vision**
- **A modular architecture**, centered on actual needs and relationships
- **Participatory governance**, with meaningful local contributions
- **Tools that are simple, documented, and reusable**
- **Freedom to deviate**, when justified and documented
- **Human-centered indicators**, valuing impact over procedures

> The method is designed for everyone — public agents, citizens, territories — not just experts.

## The TOGAFrance Cycle: A Living Spiral

The method follows a simplified interpretation of TOGAF’s ADM (Architecture Development Method), reimagined as a human-centered, iterative cycle:

[Vision] → [Diagnosis] → [Action Plan] → [Experimentation] → [Feedback] → [Adjustment] → back to [Vision]


Each iteration strengthens the project while preserving reversibility.

### 1. Vision  
A shared horizon: values, needs, purpose.  
Written in simple language, co-created with local actors.

### 2. Diagnosis  
An honest map of strengths, dysfunctions, and gaps.  
Tools: surveys, journey mapping, listening sessions.

### 3. Action Plan  
Concrete priorities with 2–3 month objectives.  
Rely on **catalogs**, **matrices**, and **role maps**.

### 4. Experimentation  
Tested solutions, monitored with qualitative indicators.  
Failures are documented and considered valuable.

### 5. Feedback & Adjustment  
Results are published, challenges named, solutions adapted.  
Each cycle improves the common memory.

## Deliverables: The Content Framework

TOGAFrance reuses the TOGAF Content Framework to organize deliverables, simplified as follows:

| Phase         | Example Deliverables                          |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Vision        | Mission Statement, Ethics Charter             |
| Diagnosis     | Need Matrix, User Journey Maps                |
| Action Plan   | Action Roadmap, Risk Table, Budget Draft      |
| Experiment    | Test Sheets, Impact Logs, Consent Forms       |
| Feedback      | Experience Reports, Learning Sheets           |

Each deliverable is:

- Named and dated
- Archived publicly (via GitHub or local wiki)
- Written in plain language
- Designed for reuse by others

## Roles and Responsibilities

TOGAFrance is not hierarchical. Roles are based on usefulness, not titles.  
Here are some example roles:

- **The Passeur**: bridges citizens and institutions  
- **The Gardien**: ensures ethical principles are respected  
- **The Veilleur**: observes weak signals and risks  
- **The Bâtisseur**: organizes tools and coordination  
- **The Relieur**: connects isolated actors and initiatives  

Each role may shift or overlap, depending on the local team. A **role matrix** is provided to visualize who contributes where during the cycle.

## What the Method Rejects

- Centralized rigidity and imposed norms  
- Software disconnected from human reality  
- Abstract KPIs without qualitative meaning  
- Pretending to innovate without involving people  
- Confusing reform with transformation

---

## What the Method Enables

- Local pilots who adapt TOGAFrance and share their lessons  
- Citizens and agents acting together, with simple tools  
- Territories regaining confidence and initiative  
- A growing **commons** of living documentation  
- A memory of what was tried, learned, or abandoned

---

## Technical and Structural Tools

- **GitHub repository**: versioned, open-source, participatory  
- **Templates and checklists**: for diagnostics, action plans, feedback  
- **Markdown format**: preferred for portability and simplicity  
- **Issues and pull requests**: enable non-technical contributions  
- **Contribution Guide**: [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md)

> Not a developer? You can translate, test, share, suggest, or link people. Every voice counts.

> The method is open, reversible, and alive.  
> You don’t need permission to start. You just need to respect the compass.  
> If you make it better, we all grow.
