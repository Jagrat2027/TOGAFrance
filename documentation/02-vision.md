# Vision

This vision is based on the initial version of the **Programme 2027**,  
available on GitHub: [https://github.com/Jagrat2027/Programme2027](https://github.com/Jagrat2027/Programme2027)

Programme 2027 is a living, evolving project that will be enriched and modified  
according to feedback from territories, contributors, and changes in national and international contexts.

Any modification to the programme that may impact the TOGAFrance vision will follow  
a rigorous change management process including:  
- the creation of **issues** to identify needs or problems,  
- the submission of **pull requests** to propose evolutions or corrections,  
- consultation of stakeholders through committees or working groups,  
- collective validation before official integration.

This process ensures coherence, transparency, and continuity of the vision,  
while allowing TOGAFrance to stay true to its goal: a human, collaborative, and sustainable transformation.

## Programme J-2027 – Table of Contents

This programme is not a catalogue of promises.  
It is a plan for human reconstruction, built from real experiences.

Each point comes from a lived experience, a need, a suffering observed or endured.

It is a living, evolving plan, and it also belongs to you.
