# Principles

A method, no matter how solid, is not enough.  
Without clear and shared principles, everything can be distorted, frozen, or betrayed.

That is why TOGAFrance relies on simple rules, called *principles* in TOGAF.  
They form our ethical compass.  
They define what can never be sacrificed, even if the context changes or pressure rises.

## 1. Why principles?

Because laws can change.  
Leaders can change.  
But core values must remain.

Without them, a reform becomes a fad.  
With them, it becomes a lasting transformation.

## 2. The 12 TOGAFrance principles

1. **Readability**  
> Everything must be understandable by a 10-year-old.  
> Otherwise, explain better. Or start over.

2. **Reversibility**  
> A reform can be stopped if it betrays its purpose.  
> Nothing is definitive if the human bond is broken.

3. **Transmission**  
> Everything created must be able to be taken up, understood, and improved.  
> We don’t build for ourselves, but for those who will come after.

4. **Real impact**  
> We judge a decision by what it changes in people’s lives.  
> Not by what it promises on paper.

5. **Useful silence**  
> What we do not yet understand, we do not modify.  
> We listen first. We act later.

6. **Balance of power**  
> No one decides alone.  
> Every actor must see the impact of their voice and actions.

7. **Dignity of every life**  
> Every reform protects the most vulnerable first.  
> If not, it is suspended.

8. **Shared memory**  
> What we do is documented, archived, and consultable.  
> We do not repeat mistakes already made.

9. **Technical sobriety**  
> We do not use more tools than necessary.  
> Progress is worthless if it erases the human bond.

10. **Territorial adaptability**  
> Each place can adjust, translate, slow down, as long as it keeps the spirit of the direction.

11. **Active listening**  
> What is said, even timidly, is taken into account.  
> Even silences are signals.

12. **Gentle justice**  
> We repair before punishing.  
> And when sanctioning, it is to help grow, not crush.

## Conclusion

These principles are our safeguards.  
They exist so that power does not deviate,  
so that action does not lose its meaning,  
and so that the country is never reduced to a mere organizational chart.

TOGAFrance is not a cold project.  
It is a compass, a promise, a shared breath.
