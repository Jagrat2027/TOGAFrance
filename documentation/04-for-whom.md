## 🤝 Openness and Shared Responsibility

TOGAFrance is based on the idea that every actor, at their level, can help build a better future—without waiting for permission, without needing to be an expert.

The method is flexible: it adapts to the pace and reality of each person or collective.  
All that is asked: **document your path, share your insights, and stay aligned with the founding principles.**

TOGAFrance is a shared journey, not a finished product.  
Each participant contributes to writing the map as we walk the path.
