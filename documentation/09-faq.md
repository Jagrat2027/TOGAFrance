## ‚ùì General

**What is TOGAFrance?**  
TOGAFrance is an adaptation of the TOGAF framework, designed to support systemic and ethical transformation of French public services, centered on human needs, transparency, and local experimentation.

**Is it a political party or movement?**  
No. TOGAFrance is a methodological framework. It is non-partisan and open to anyone who wants to contribute to public service transformation.

**Is it a mandatory standard?**  
Not at all. It‚Äôs an open method that can be adapted to local contexts, as long as the core principles are respected.

## üõ† Methodology

**Do I need to know TOGAF to use TOGAFrance?**  
No. TOGAFrance simplifies and adapts TOGAF‚Äôs logic to make it accessible to any motivated group (citizens, associations, public agents, elected officials...).

**Can I adapt the method to my local reality?**  
Yes. TOGAFrance encourages local adaptation, as long as the core principles (clarity, reversibility, transmission) are respected and any changes are documented.

**Do I have to apply everything?**  
No. You can start small ‚Äî one step, one service, one neighborhood. The goal is to experiment, not to impose.

## üìÇ Documentation & Tools

**Where can I find templates to get started?**  
Check the `/examples` and `/tools/templates` folders. You‚Äôll find editable templates for diagnostics, action plans, and feedback reports.

**Can I use Word or Excel?**  
Yes. You can use Markdown, Word, Excel, or any format that suits your team. Markdown is recommended for compatibility and version control.

**Are there scripts to convert files?**  
Yes, in the `/tools/scripts` folder. You‚Äôre also welcome to propose new ones.

## üå± Pilot Territories

**What do I need to launch a pilot?**  
You need:
- A team (even a small one),
- A diagnosis and an action plan (see templates),
- The will to share your feedback (successes and challenges).

**Do I need permission to start?**  
No. The method is open. But if you inform us about your initiative, we can support you, connect you with other territories, and highlight your work.

**Is there help for local facilitation?**  
Yes. A facilitation kit and a referent network are being developed (see `/tools` and `/pilots-territories`).

## üß≠ Governance & Principles

**What if my values differ from some of the principles?**  
The 12 principles are TOGAFrance‚Äôs ethical foundation. They‚Äôre open to discussion, but they ensure coherence. Any divergence should be reasoned and documented.

Each pilot is autonomous but accountable. If the principles are violated, contributions may be excluded from the shared corpus or flagged as off-frame.
