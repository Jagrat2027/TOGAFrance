## Preface – The image that tells the story of TOGAF

![TOGAF Vision Image](../medias/images/Togaf%20-%20Vision%20image.png)

In the image above — well known by enterprise architects — two frameworks face each other:  
- The first shows tangled, disorganized pieces, symbolizing a fragmented, unreadable state  
  where reforms pile up without connection or coherence.  
- The second shows the same pieces, now neatly arranged in readable circles.

This is the promise of TOGAF, and thus TOGAFrance: **to transform chaos into coherence, without imposing a single model**.

TOGAFrance is built on a simple idea:  
**each part of the nation can find its place in a clear, human, and transformable whole.**  
Not by obeying a rigid plan, but by contributing to a shared direction.

This image became our visual starting point, our initial symbol.

Welcome to the TOGAFrance Practical Guide.

This document aims to provide a clear and structured presentation of the TOGAFrance method—a national framework designed to support the transformation of French public services, restore citizen trust, and foster a collaborative and ethical approach to change.

Whether you are a citizen, an elected official, a public agent, or a member of a pilot territory, this guide will help you understand the principles, methodology, and resources available to actively participate in the renewal of our institutions.

The guide is organized into thematic chapters to facilitate your reading and practical application.

Thank you for joining this collective journey toward a more just, transparent, and participative public service.
