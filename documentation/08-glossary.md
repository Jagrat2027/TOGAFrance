A united country is not one where everyone thinks alike,  
but one where people can speak together without losing each other.

TOGAFrance uses precise words ‚Äî not to exclude,  
but to gain time, clarity, and connection.

This glossary is a shared dictionary.  
Each word is explained simply, so no one is left behind.

## üß≠ Core TOGAFrance Concepts

**TOGAFrance**  
A national adaptation of the TOGAF framework to transform public services through ethics, transparency, and citizen participation. It is not a political movement, but a method open to all.

**Principles (Ethical Compass)**  
Twelve fundamental commitments ‚Äî like clarity, reversibility, transmission ‚Äî that ensure all reforms remain human-centered, even under pressure.

**Pilot Territory**  
Any place (municipality, school, hospital, etc.) that applies TOGAFrance in real life and documents its results, including failures and doubts.

**Cycle**  
TOGAFrance follows a dynamic spiral based on TOGAF‚Äôs ADM:  
`Vision ‚Üí Diagnosis ‚Üí Action Plan ‚Üí Experimentation ‚Üí Feedback ‚Üí Adjustment ‚Üí Vision`

**Reversibility**  
Any reform can be stopped or revised if it breaks the human link.  
Nothing is irreversible if it no longer serves the public good.

**Transmission**  
Every decision, tool, or model must be understandable, reusable, and improvable.  
We build for those who will follow.

**Real Impact**  
A policy is judged by what it changes in people‚Äôs lives ‚Äî not by promises or paperwork.

**Commons**  
Collective goods like education, health, water, justice‚Ä¶ TOGAFrance aims to protect and renew them.

**Territory**  
A living community or institution ‚Äî town, region, school, agency ‚Äî that becomes a unit of experimentation.

**Memory**  
Everything done is written, archived, and accessible.  
We avoid repeating past mistakes by learning from them.

**Silence as Wisdom**  
What we don‚Äôt understand yet, we don‚Äôt try to change.  
We listen before we act.

**Technical Sobriety**  
No tool should erase the human link.  
We use what‚Äôs necessary ‚Äî nothing more.

## üåÄ This Glossary Is Alive

Words are like tools:  
They are not here to confuse ‚Äî but to help us build together.

Everyone is welcome to suggest additions, improvements, or simplifications.  
Because TOGAFrance is not jargon ‚Äî it‚Äôs a reconstruction language.
