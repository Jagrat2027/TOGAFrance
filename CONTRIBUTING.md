## Priorities and Tasks

### 1. Essential Document Templates
- Local diagnosis (current situation, needs, strengths/weaknesses)
- Action plan or roadmap (objectives, timeline, stakeholders)
- Experience report (successes, obstacles, adjustments, proposals)

### 2. Tracking Tables
- Experimentation dashboard (progress, blockers, feedback)
- Human and organizational impact evaluation grids

### 3. Practical Guides and Tutorials
- TOGAFrance methodology user guide
- Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
- Simplified glossary

### 4. Digital Tools and Collaborative Spaces
- Collaborative platform or space (wiki, document sharing, downloadable templates)
- Shared dashboard or open data on ongoing experiments

### 5. Support Network and Reference Contacts
- List of references (volunteers, experts, local coordinators)
- Communication channels (workshops, video meetings, forums, etc.)

### 6. Freedom of Adaptation and Sharing
- Each territory is free to adapt the method ("right to detour")
- But must document and share its choices, successes, and challenges

---

## How to contribute?

### 1. Propose a territorial or local experiment

- Download or create an experimentation kit (diagnosis template, roadmap, tracking table, etc.)
- Adapt it to your territory, structure, collective, or team
- Carry out the experiment, documenting each step, success, adjustment, or difficulty

### 2. Share your feedback

- Write an **experience report** (successes, challenges, proposals, local adaptations…)
- Submit it via a _pull request_ on the main repository, or send it to the coordination team
- **Help us launch and animate exchange spaces:** Discord, Twitch channels, external forums, or other collaborative tools.  
- **Propose or co-organize workshops, Q&A sessions, or discussion groups** to support contributors and pilot territories.  
- **Suggest or help develop new ways for the community to connect, share, and support each other.**


### 3. Improve the method, tools, or documentation

- Suggest improvements to document templates, guides, or tracking tables
- Propose new digital tools or educational resources
- Contribute to the glossary, FAQ, translation, or outreach

### 4. Correct or report an inconsistency

- Open an “issue” or submit a _pull request_ for any correction or clarification
- Always prioritize kindness, clarity, and the transmission of your experience

## Golden Rules

- **Clarity**: contribute documents and feedback that are readable and accessible to all
- **Transparency**: explain what was attempted, what worked or not, and why
- **Reversibility**: any experiment can be adjusted or withdrawn if it no longer serves the human connection
- **Ethics**: respect the diversity of territories, approaches, and adoption speeds
